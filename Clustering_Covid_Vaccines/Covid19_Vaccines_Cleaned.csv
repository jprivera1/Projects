Immediately at the time of the administration, I noticed numbness in my left pinky & ring finger that extended to my elbow.  I figured they may have ?hit a nerve? so I called my PCP afterward.  My PCP advised me to take Ibuprofen 600mg and to call the next day with any new or worsening symptoms.  When I woke up the next day, I noticed numbness in both of my feet (with continued numbness in my left forearm).  I had a visit with my PCP where I had a normal neurological exam except for the paresthesias.  I did not sleep well the night before, so I was sent home with a medication to assist in sleeping and to observe over the holidays to see if my condition improved.  Otherwise, my PCP would order more testing.   Monday after the holidays (12/28/2020), my symptoms didn?t improve.  I noticed that I have constant numbness in bilateral hands and feet with periodic episodes where my entire left leg and then my entire right arm had tingling/numbness/crawling sensation.  I had some fasting labs done on 12/29/2020: CBC, CMP, CRP, Sed Rate, TSH, Magnesium, eGFR were all within normal limits.  My B12 was slightly low at 210 (normal levels are listed as 211-911).  I received a B12 injection that same day and started OTC B12 supplements.  I am currently waiting on the referral to go through for an EMG.    Since receiving my B12 injection, I noticed a few more episodes over the New Year holiday break. From 12/31/20-01/02/21, I had this tingling/unpleasant sensation episode on my whole right side. My entire arm and leg were being affected; the episode was constant throughout most of the day with a few moments of relief with hot showers/heating blanket. No weakness noted.  I currently have a message out to my PCP to update.",OTH,Lutera,Anxiety,Anxiety,,,1.0,,No known allergies,,COVID19,PFIZER\BIONTECH,,,IM,Blood magnesium normal,Blood thyroid stimulating hormone,C-reactive protein normal,Full blood count normal,Glomerular filtration rate normal,9

The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is difficult to differentiate from surrounding retroperitoneal fat.  The pancreatic duct is top normal caliber at 3 mm. Unremarkable liver. Slightly distended gallbladder containing thickened partially congealed bile.  No calcified stones.  No sonographic evidence of cholecystitis. The extrahepatic ducts measure up to 8 mm, normal for patient's age. Stable septated right side renal cyst compared to 2018.

No evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis noted. LEFT LOWER LIMB: No evidence of acute or chronic deep vein thrombosis. No evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis noted.  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute intra-abdominal abnormality. 2. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis but no discernible pericholecystic inflammatory changes.  There is a tiny calcification in the porta hepatis near the base of the gallbladder, relationship to ductal structures cannot be determined on  noncontrast imaging although could potentially be vascular. There does not appear to be intrahepatic duct dilatation.  3. 1 cm indeterminate right renal nodule.   4. Possible small pancreatic cysts. 5. Colonic diverticulosis without focal diverticulitis. 6.  Mild splenomegaly. 7. Trace abdominal ascites. Although contrast imaging is preferential to evaluate the parenchymal organs, patient has impaired renal function, and noncontrast MRCP may still provide additional information regarding parenchymal organs and ductal structure findings as described. Limited study without IV contrast. 1/9/21 XR knee 1 or 2 vw right IMPRESSION: No acute osseous abnormality. Degenerative changes as described 1/11/21 XR chest portable IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 1/12/21 MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST WITH MRCP IMPRESSION: Dominant 2.2 cm stone in the gallbladder neck with prominent distention of the gallbladder but without gallbladder wall thickening.  Trace nonspecific pericholecystic fluid in this patient with trace perihepatic and upper abdominal ascites as well as  mesenteric and retroperitoneal edema. No choledocholithiasis.  Borderline common duct.  Minor prominence of central intrahepatic biliary tree. Multiple cystic pancreatic lesions most consistent with intraductal papillary mucinous pancreatic neoplasm.  The largest these measures up to 21 mm in the pancreatic head.  No main pancreatic ductal enlargement. Based on institutional consensus and  recent literature gastroenterology consult and/or surgical oncology consult is recommended.  By these criteria, endoscopic ultrasound is likely warranted.

HISTORY: Generalized abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.  TECHNIQUE: Routine axial images were obtained after the administration of 95 cc Isovue-300 intravenously. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were made. CT dose modulation was utilized.  CT ABDOMEN: There is dependent atelectasis in the lung bases. There is chronic bronchiectasis in the lingula and inferior aspect of the right middle lobe.  There is a 9 mm cyst in the left lobe of the liver. There is also a 5 mm low-density area in the dome of the left lobe of liver; this is too small to fully characterize. There are dilated intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts. The common duct is enlarged, measuring 1.4 cm. The pancreatic duct is not dilated. The pancreas appears unremarkable. The spleen and adrenal glands are within normal limits. There are simple cysts in both kidneys; no further radiologic workup is indicated for the cysts.. Mild strandy changes are noted around both kidneys, likely age related senescent changes. There is no hydronephrosis. There is calcific atherosclerosis within the aorta, but no evidence of aneurysm. There is no bowel obstruction or free air.  CT PELVIS: Extensive diverticulosis is noted throughout the colon, with no evidence of acute diverticulitis. There is no bowel obstruction, free air, or free fluid. The appendix is not visualized; there are no pericecal inflammatory changes. There is no bladder wall thickening. The uterus is absent.  There are degenerative changes within the lumbar spine. Bones are osteopenic. There is no fracture.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is bibasilar atelectasis. 2. There are dilated intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts; findings could be from prior cholecystectomy. Choledocholithiasis or ampullary mass cannot be excluded. The common duct is not dilated. If clinically indicated, a nonemergent MRI could be performed. 3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis. 4. There are strandy changes around both kidneys, most likely age related senescent changes.
